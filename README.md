# Impact-of-COVID-19-on-Global-Oil-Prices-Analysis-of-Nigerian-Case-Data-February---April-2020-
Project Summary This analysis investigates the correlation between COVID-19 cases in Nigeria and fluctuations in global oil prices between February and April 2020. During the early months of the pandemic, COVID-19-related disruptions significantly impacted economic indicators, especially in oil-dependent economies like Nigeria.


Key Skills

Data Visualization: Leveraging graphical representation to show COVID-19 cases and oil price trends.
Economic Analysis: Interpreting data on oil prices and reserves during a pandemic.
Trend Analysis: Identifying correlations between COVID-19 cases and economic metrics.
Public Health Impact Assessment: Assessing the potential economic effects of pandemic-related disruptions on oil prices.

Methodology

Data Collection: Compiled data on COVID-19 cases in Nigeria, global COVID-19 confirmed and death cases, oil prices, and Nigeria's gross reserves over the period.
Data Visualization: Developed a dashboard displaying monthly and daily trends to identify shifts in oil prices, reserves, and COVID-19 cases.
Correlation Analysis: Examined potential correlations between the rise in COVID-19 cases and the decline in oil prices and reserves.
Impact Assessment: Analyzed how COVID-19 affected Nigeria's economic indicators, focusing on oil prices and reserves, to understand economic vulnerability during global health crises.

Observations

COVID-19 Case Trends in Nigeria:
The total COVID-19 cases in Nigeria increased from 3 cases in February to 821 cases in March and 1,251 cases in April.

Global COVID-19 Impact:
The global confirmed cases grew from 8 million in March to 14 million in April.
New global cases escalated significantly, from 1,000 in early March to 82,000 by early April, showing a rapid spread of the virus.

Global Death Cases:
Global death cases were 0.34 million in March and 0.32 million in April, indicating a sustained high mortality rate during the early months of the pandemic.

Oil Price Fluctuations:
The oil price started around $77-88 in early March, dropped to $23 by late March, spiked briefly to $76, and then fell back to $23 by April. This indicates significant volatility in response to the pandemic's economic impact.

Nigeria’s Gross Reserves:
Gross reserves in Nigeria started at $36.33 billion in February, decreased gradually to $36.22 billion in early March, and dropped to $34.67 billion by April 5th. This decline reflects economic strain due to reduced oil prices and demand.


Recommendations

Economic Diversification:
The pandemic's impact on oil prices highlights the need for Nigeria to diversify its economy beyond oil dependence. Investments in alternative sectors could provide economic stability during global crises.

Strategic Reserve Management:
The decline in gross reserves suggests a need for Nigeria to implement policies to stabilize reserves. Establishing a contingency fund or enhancing reserve management practices could mitigate economic shocks from sudden revenue drops.

Public Health Preparedness:
As seen in the rapid escalation of COVID-19 cases, Nigeria’s healthcare system and response capacity are critical for economic resilience. Improving health infrastructure and pandemic response strategies can help reduce future economic impacts.

Monitoring Global Market Trends:
Given the sharp fluctuations in oil prices, Nigeria should monitor global market signals and be prepared to adjust export strategies based on global demand changes.

Pandemic-Proof Policies for Oil Prices:
Developing price-stabilizing policies, such as temporary subsidies or strategic alliances, may help cushion the impact of future pandemics or global crises on oil prices.


This analysis underscores the profound effect that a global health crisis can have on oil-dependent economies like Nigeria. Insights drawn from this dashboard can inform strategies to build resilience against similar future disruptions.
